I have developed a strong foundation in cybersecurity through my participation in the UCF Impact Cybersecurity Course, where I gained hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities, defending networks, and implementing security protocols. 

My skills in areas such as ethical hacking, threat analysis, and risk management have been honed through both coursework and practical exercises. With a deep interest in securing digital infrastructures, I aspire to become a cybersecurity professional who not only protects organizations from evolving threats but also contributes to the development of innovative security solutions. 

My goal is to continuously expand my expertise and make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity field
